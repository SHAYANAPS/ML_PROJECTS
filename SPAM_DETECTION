📧 Spam Detector App

This project is a Spam Detector that uses machine learning to classify text messages as either spam or ham (not spam). The application is built using Python and integrates with Gradio for a simple and user-friendly web interface.

🚀 Features
Train & Evaluate Models: Logistic Regression and Linear SVM are used for training and evaluation.
Text Vectorization: Utilizes CountVectorizer for text feature extraction.
Persistence: Save and load models and vectorizers with pickle.
Interactive Web Interface: A Gradio-powered app for easy text classification.
Example Prediction: Detect spam with a real-world message example.

📊 How It Works

Data Loading:

The spam.csv dataset is loaded and preprocessed.

Feature Extraction:

CountVectorizer is used to convert text into numerical features.

Model Training:

Both Logistic Regression and Linear SVM models are trained on the dataset.

Model Persistence:

The trained SVM model and CountVectorizer are saved using pickle.

Prediction:

Users can input a text message, and the model predicts if it's Spam or Ham.

Web Interface:

A Gradio-powered interface allows real-time testing.

📊 Example Usage

Input: You have won $1000000000! Send your bank information now!
Output: This message is a : Spam 🚨
